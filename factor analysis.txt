In a dendogram,

bottom to top is agglomerative approach(all clusters are individual datapoints, based on 
similarity we combine them)
top to bottom is divisive approach(first all datapoints are single cluster, based on disimilarity
we seperate them)



With increase in number of features , there can be change of multicolinearity!

If features are independent of each other then their is no multicolinearity
(i.e., high correlation between features)
High correlation between temp and weight!

Factor Analysis:
-Reducing dimensionality and shrinking dataset that is more manageable and more understandable!

Regression:
- tells the relatioship among variables and quantifies the relationship using set of equations.

- Regression line placing itself in such that it will be equidistance between all samples!

Factor Analysis:
PCA- we calc the variance. variance is stdev pow 2
The higher the variance the more the information
the lower the variance the less the information
